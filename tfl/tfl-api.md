- [ ] Paired Projects
    - [ ] Swap the drivers after every pomodorro
    - [ ] Pomodorro technique in use throughout

## TFL Workshop

### What is the TFL API?
**Insert Description here**

**Go through the API Documentation online**

**Direct them to the folder which contains the preset HTML and CSS**

**Talk through how we would go about building the latest arrival app**  
- [ ] What API call do we need to use to get the latest arrivals for the    tube?  
- [ ] Lets get this working with a preset location, so that when the user clicks submit with anything filled in, it will return the latest arrivals for Mile End Station  
    - [ ] This will require some DOM Manipulation so work through it step by step until we can see the simple results in the page  

- [ ] Next step is to make the API Call dynamic so that it will take any string we put in and then return the results for the given station.
    - [ ] Does this feel _hacky_? We are having to ask the user to enter the station name exactly as found on the API itslelf ( i.e. Mile End Underground Station )
    - [ ] How can we make it better?

- [ ] CHECK TIME - **if** we have time left then make it better by fetching the list of underground stations and autofilling them below the input field. **else** break for lunch and maybe they can build the functionality for the project.
